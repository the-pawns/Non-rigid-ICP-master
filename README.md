# nricp - Non-rigid iterative closest point

Code from https://github.com/RhythmJnh/Non-rigid-ICP

nricp is a MATLAB implementation of a non-rigid variant of the iterative closest point algorithm. It can be used to register 3D surfaces or point-clouds. The method is described in the following paper:

'Optimal Step Nonrigid ICP Algorithms for Surface Registration', Amberg, Romandhani and Vetter, CVPR, 2007.

Features:
* Non-rigid and local deformations of a template surface or point cloud.
* Iterative stiffness reduction allows for global intitial transformations that become increasingly localised.  
* Optional initial rigid registration using standard iterative closest point.
* Optional bi-directional distance metric which encourages surface deformations to cover more of the target surface
* Handles missing data in the target surface by ignoring correspondences with points on target edges.
* **Optional landmarks can be used.**

## Dependencies

Requires:
* geom3d - http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24484-geom3d
* Toolbox Graph - http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph
* Iterative Closest Point - http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27804-iterative-closest-point 

## Installation

Download this directory and the dependencies and add them to your MATLAB path.

## Usage

You need to provide the models to be registered, and then modify the test.m, after that you can run test.m.
